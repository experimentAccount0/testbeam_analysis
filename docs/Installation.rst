Installation guide
==================

The following step-by-step installation guide explains in more details how you can setup *testbeam analysis*
under Windows, Linux or OS X operating system. A decent PC with at least 8 Gb of RAM is recommended! The Python
distribution and editor chosen here are of cause not mandatory, but have been tested to work. Thus this guide is useful
especially for Python beginners.

Installing Miniconda Python
***************************

Miniconda Python is a Python distribution providing a simple to use package manager to install lots of Python packages for data analysis, plotting and I/O.
These packages are heavily used in *testbeam analysis*. Download and install Miniconda by following this link: `Continuum Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_.
Choose the 64-bit version of Python 2.7.x or Python 3.6.x.

.. NOTE::
   Under Windows Python 2.7 is recommended, since there is no free or easy to install Python 3.6 compiler available.

Installing C++ Compiler
***********************
- Linux:
  Install *gcc* via package manager, e.g. on Ubuntu run:

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     sudo apt-get install build-essential

- Windows:
  Install `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 <http://aka.ms/vcpython27>`_.

- OS X:
  Install `Xcode <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835>`_ from App Store and install Xcode Command Line Tools by running
  
  .. code-block:: bash
     
     xcode-select install

Installing Eclipse with PyDev Plugin
************************************
Eclipse is a state of the art Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for almost every important software programming language
(JAVA, C++, Python, Fortran, Ruby, Mathematica). It has a plug in system to extend the development environment. PyDev is the Python IDE plugin for Eclipse.
Eclipse needs a Java runtime environmet (JRE) and will not start if this is not installed.

.. NOTE::
   Under Windows it is recommend to use the Eclipse 32-bit version, even on a 64-bit machine. Since Eclipse 64-bit needs JRE 64-bit
   and Oracle JRE 64-bit does not provide automatic updates. This puts the PC at risk of viruses.

1. Download the Eclipse from `Eclipse Homepage <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads>`_. Eclipse does not need to be installed, the archive has 
   to be extracted to a folder of your choice. Eclipse can be executed by double clicking on the executable.
2. Eclipse asks for a workspace path where the projects will be located on your harddrive. Standard settings are sufficient.
3. Close the welcome screen.
4. Install the PyDev plugin by clicking on *Help -> Install New Software* . Press add and fill the form (*name = PyDev*, *location = http://pydev.org/updates*):

   .. image:: _static/installation/PyDev.jpg

   Select PyDev and install (accept license agreement and trust the certificate).
  
   .. NOTE::
      Under Linux you need at least *Java 7*, otherwise *PyDev* will not show up in Eclipse without any error message. Please install *Java 7* and activate it.
      In Ubuntu activate it with
      :code:`sudo update-alternatives --config java`

5. Add PyDev perspective to Eclipse and select it. The button is located in the upper rigth corner:

	.. image:: _static/installation/Perspective.jpg

6. Goto *Window -> Preferences -> PyDev -> Interpreters -> Python Interpreter* and press new.

	.. image:: _static/installation/AnacondaSetup1.jpg

   Select the Python executable in :code:`/home/<username>/anaconda/bin/` on *Linux* or :code:`c:\Anaconda\`
   on *Windows* (optionally use the :code:`Anaconda/env/<environment name>/` folder if you are using Anaconda environments) and press the OK button.
   Everything is set up automatically. More details are given `here <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/ide_integration.html>`_.

Installing Required Python Packages
***********************************

Open a console and type one by one:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda update conda
   conda install --yes numpy cython pytables scipy matplotlib nose numba mock pytest-cov
   pip install progressbar-latest pixel_clusterizer pykalman pylandau pytest

On *Windows* additionally run:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   conda install pywin32

Installing testbeam analysis
****************************
1. Goto *File -> Import -> Git* and select Projects from Git
2. Click clone URI and type the *testbeam analysis* repository (`https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/testbeam_analysis <https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/testbeam_analysis>`_)
   If you have a `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ account you can add the credentials here
3. Click next, select all branches, click next and specify the directory where *testbeam analysis* will be cloned to.
   Wait until the download of the code is finished. *testbeam analysis* *master* branch and *releases* are tested best, but newest features and bugfixes
   are in the *development* branch. Generally the *development* branch is supposed to work without errors and can be used.
4. Check *Check out as project configured using the New Project Wizard*
5. Select *PyDev -> PyDevProject*
6. Give the project a name, select the folder where the *testbeam analysis* was cloned to (e.g. :code:`/home/username/git/testbeam_analysis`) and click finish
7. Open a shell and run the following command from the *testbeam analysis* folder:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      python setup.py develop

   This will compile and install *testbeam analysis* to the environment.
   
   .. NOTE::
      On Windows if the compilation fails use the Visual Studio Command promt to run the setup script. Because distutils sometimes cannot find VS
      due to multiple/old VS installation. It might also be needed to install and
      `activate the 64-bit compiler <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x4d2c09s%28v=vs.90%29.aspx>`_.
